  abstract  = {Goal of this research is to introduce how the implementation of Interaction Design can solve problem of UI/UX in mobile devices. The method used here is Interaction Design, the study of designing interactive digital products with user-centered approach to deliver engaging and better user experiences (UX). One of interesting interactive product is University Timetable Plotting System, an application used to manage course scheduling that produces busy screen with large timetable. Problems occurred because this system have inadequate support for user with relatively low resolution (like smartphone) compared to desktop thus affect negative UX. Interaction design workflow begins with collecting data to establishing requirement, following with designing alternatives. Based on usability evaluation, Instruction approach proved to produce high satisfaction rating rather than direct manipulation approach. This research proved that Interaction Design could be utilize on the process of creating Interactive Products. In conclusion its challenging to convert plotting UI into mobile version and this paper demonstrate that Interaction design successfully guides developer and UI designer to design better UI/UX experiences.}

  abstract = {A key process for post-secondary educational institutions is the definition of course timetables and classroom assignments. Manual scheduling methods require enormous amounts of time and resources to deliver results of questionable quality, and multiple course and classroom conflicts usually occur. This article presents a scheduling system implemented in a Web environment. This system generates optimal schedules via an integer-programming model. Among its functionalities, this system enables direct interaction with instructors in order to gather data on their time availability for teaching courses. The results demonstrate that significant improvements over the typical fully manual process were obtained.}

  abstract  = {The modeling and solution approaches being used to automate construction of course timetables at a large university are discussed. A course structure model is presented that allows this complex real-world problem to be described using a classical formulation. The problem is then tackled utilizing a course timetabling solver model that transforms it into a constraint satisfaction and optimization problem. The tiered structure of this approach provides flexibility that is helpful in solving the multiple subproblems that arise from decomposition of the university-wide problem. A production system has been partially implemented and results of early use are presented. Practical issues raised during the implementation of the automated timetabling system are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The fifth International Timetabling Competition ITC2021 aims to instigate further research on automated sports timetabling. The competition’s problem consists of constructing a compact double round-robin tournament with 16 to 20 teams while respecting various hard constraints and minimizing the penalties from violated soft constraints. This paper focuses on the organization of the ITC2021 competition, with a particular focus on the generation of a set of artificial though challenging, realistic, and diverse problem instances. For the latter, we present a set of features describing the structure of the problem instances, and use these features to construct the so-called instance space for sports timetabling. Several gaps in this space hint that existing problem instances from the literature are not very diverse. We therefore propose a novel integer programming approach to determine the feature values that cover these gaps, and show how to generate associated problem instances. Finally, we provide an overview of the participants and their contributions.}

  abstract  = {Computer solution of timetabling, scheduling and rostering problems has been addressed in the literature since the 1950's. Early mathematical formulations proved impossible to solve given the limited computer power of the era. However, heuristics, often very specialised, were used for certain problems from a very early date, although the term heuristic was not generally recognised until later; a few guaranteed optimality, some consistently produced good solutions, but most became unwieldy when adjusted to deal with practical situations. In some cases, weaknesses in the heuristics were overcome by appeal to manual intervention. Mathematical approaches to some problems returned to favour, successfully, around 1980. Some of the subsequent developments of these are very powerful in practical situations, but they are no panacea, and metaheuristics are the flavour of the nineties.},
